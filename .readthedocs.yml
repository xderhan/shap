    # 2. Build the HTML documentation (Output in $READTHEDOCS_OUTPUT/html)

      docs $READTHEDOCS_OUTPUT/html
      
    # 3. Build the LaTeX source files (Output in $READTHEDOCS_OUTPUT/latex)
    # This step generates SHAP.tex and the Makefile at this specific path.

      docs $READTHEDOCS_OUTPUT/latex

    # 4. Compile the PDF from the generated source
    
    # FIX: Change directory directly into the location where the Makefile was created (Step 3).
    - cd $READTHEDOCS_OUTPUT/latex
    
    # Execute the Makefile to compile SHAP.tex into SHAP.pdf.
    # This now works because the 'make' utility is run in the same folder as the Makefile.
    - make

    # 5. Move and rename the final PDF file for Read the Docs to find
    - mkdir -p $READTHEDOCS_OUTPUT/pdf/
    # The compiled file is named SHAP.pdf based on your conf.py setting.
    - mv SHAP.pdf $READTHEDOCS_OUTPUT/pdf/$READTHEDOCS_PROJECT.pdf
