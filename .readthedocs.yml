    # 4. Compile the PDF from LaTeX and move it to the final destination
    
    # FIX: Change directory to the LaTeX output folder and run 'make'
    # The Sphinx-generated Makefile in this directory knows how to compile SHAP.tex
    # using xelatex (as set in conf.py) and the inkscape utility.
    - cd $READTHEDOCS_OUTPUT/latex
    - make

    # Move and rename the final PDF file to the location expected by RTD
    # The file is named SHAP.pdf based on your latex_documents setting.
    - mkdir -p $READTHEDOCS_OUTPUT/pdf/
    - mv SHAP.pdf $READTHEDOCS_OUTPUT/pdf/$READTHEDOCS_PROJECT.pdf
